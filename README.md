## ü§ñ Use of AI Services 
We used AI to generate recommendations in our app.
### OpenAI API 
1. Retrieve the following 5 user preferences from database:  
   - reason for traveling
   - preferred destination type 
   - month for travel
   - activity to do at the destination
   - continent to travel to    
2. Prompt GPT using preference answers to recommend 5 lesser-known countries that are safe to travel to and return the response in the desired JSON response format. 
   - name of country
   - location of the country
   - one sentence description of the country 
3. Responses are cross-checked to the country database and validated before they are shown 
  **see Dataset section below for more information on how we filtered out the dataset*
4. Response is displayed on the gacha page and used by Unsplash API to generate the images. 
5. Prompt GPT using preferences and the country they selected to generate 6 interesting facts about the country and return the response in the the desired JSON response format.
   - an interesting fact about the country
   - a fact about an interesting business in the country 
   - a nature fact about the country
   - a fun activity to do in the country
   - a fact about the national dish eaten in the country
   - a fact about the language spoken in the country
6. Response is displayed on the main page 

### Limitations
 
<b>Limited Control</b>: While the prompt is used to generate the AI's response, the model can produce unexpected or undesired outputs.
- heavy testing was done to see the quality of the response
- tweaks were made to the prompts to improve the overall accuracy of the generated responses 
- preference quiz questions were changed to optimize the prompts
- additional variables ie. `continent` of the preffered country was added to enhance accuracy

<b> Rate Limit</b>: Only a maximum of 3 requests to the API can be made per minute. Exceeding this limit can throttle the requests. In addition, if a high volume of requests are made to the API by other users, that can slow down our response times. 
- we added a loading spinner to let the user know the response is generating

## üìä DataSet   

[Kaggle dataset referenced](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulhamitcelik/international-tourism-receipts)

Our idea was inspired by this dataset. The responses generated by the AI are cross-checked with the values in this dataset. This validation helps to verify the correctness and consistency of the information we provide.

### How did we use the dataset?       
The kaggle set we used is the tourism receipts of over 250 countries for the past 20 years. Our goal is to filter out the under-travelled countries based on their tourism receipts history. We created below two ratios that help to identify the under-travelled country:

1. üßæ<b> Tourism ratio </b>
-  this ratio is calculated for every country by taking the tourism receipts and divided by the sum of the word tourism receipts in a year.
-  (Tourism ratio = tourism receipts / world tourism receipts). 
-  This ratio serves to measures the percentage of the contribution of the country in tourism comparing to the global tourism. <b> The country with a tourism ratio <1% is considered under-travelled for that particular year </b>
   
2. üë£ <b>Under-tourism/ unpopularity Index </b>
- this index is calculated for every country by counting the occurrence of it when it indicates under-tourism, and divided by the total count of the tourism records for the country
- (Unpopularity Index = the count of the under-travelled occurrance / the count of the tourism records). 
- This ratio measures the history performance of the country by evaluating the frequency of a country that shows under-tourism. <b>Countries with an unpopularity Index of over than 50% are considered under-travelled destinations.</b>
  
By utilizing both of the indexes, we managed to filter out a list of under-travelled countries based on their history performance in tourism.
